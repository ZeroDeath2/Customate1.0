# Call Center Automation with Twilio, Next.js, and Node.js

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive solution for call center automation, leveraging the powerful Twilio communication platform for handling calls.

The backend, powered by Node.js, manages the logic, data flow, and communication with the Twilio APIs.
